# Heart-Rate-Variability-Preictal-Identification-Epilepsy
Heart Rate Variability Analysis for the Identification of the Preictal Interval in Patients with Drug-resistant Epilepsy

__How to run the code:__

Run main_extract_features.m script. This is an example code to run feature extraction using example data from two 5-min RR interval series (corresponding to the ones depicted in Figures S5, S6 and S7 in Supplementary Material).
