# Heart-Rate-Variability-Preictal-Identification-Epilepsy
Heart Rate Variability Analysis for the Identification of the Preictal Interval in Patients with Drug-resistant Epilepsy

Code to perform clustering on the three-by-three combination of HRV features, using the following clustering methods:

- K-means (KM)
- Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AH)
- Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN)
- Gaussian mixture model clustering (GMM)


__How to run the code:__

1 - Run file main_clustering.m after defining the number of features to combine (in variable feat_comb).
